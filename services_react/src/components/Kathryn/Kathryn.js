        <h2>Kathryn Roberts</h2>
        <h4>South Carolina Senate Seat</h4>
        <p>
          This project was a lot of fun and included a lot of problems that are
          common with web projects. Kathryn decided to run for a opening seat in
          the South Carolina senate. She lives in the district and finally
          decided to act on her growing concerns for her community, state, and
          country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her needs were few. She wanted a simple site, like a landing page,
          that she could use to talk about herself and discuss some key
          concerns. Possibly show an event schedule and collect email's from
          anyone who was interested. The party demanded a link to a donation
          service.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Since she had no need to maintain the site I decided to hand code it
          in html and css. I designed a concept she liked in Figma and she
          supplied the context for the site. She had several ideas that she
          liked and we worked to put them into the design. Since I was hand
          coding the site, I pushed my code to GitHub and published through
          Vercel. This allowed her to view the living site as it took shape.
        </p>
        <p>The Trello board was used as a project management tool </p>

          Kathryn Trello Board
        </a>
        <p>
          I used the Trello board to layout and track components and stage
          completion. It was also used to make suggestions for potential
          improvements.

          Notion Design System
        </a>
        <p>
          I used the design system template from Notion to create the Design
          System. This allowed me to create a resource to refer back to and
          allowed me to keep the site uniform in concept.

          Figma Design Concept
        </a>
        <p>
          I used Figma to recreate a yard sign design concept first, as I was
          playing around with some site concepts. I focused in on one that had a
          common layout, solid design, good feel and presented it to Kathryn.
          She was so easy going and trusted my judgement. I am disappointed that
          some files have been deleted from this project. Actually this board is
          not the original and much was lost, however, I was able to recreate
          enough to present a solid concept here.

          Dev Code
        </a>
        <p>
          The site was hand coded in html, css and some javascript. I used
          VScode to write the code and pushed updates to github. This is the
          repo for the project so anyone can review the code.

          Promo Page
        </a>
        <p>
          Kathryn wanted the site modeled after Warren's site. At the time the
          site was created, Warren was running for president and the Warren site
          loaded with a promo site that gathered either information or
          donations. This promo page was over the same concept. It was never
          used. This page is labor intensive and is part of the original site
          stack.

          Vercel and Netlify are sites that work well with a jamstack. A kind of
          Software as a Service (SaaS)it allows for code pushed to github, to be
          parsed and shown in all it's glory. It is very handy when working for
          clients that want solid code and see the benefits as soon as possible.
          Testing features can be done easily with this system.

          Web Site
        </a>
        <p>
          Kathryn's site is set up on NameCheap.com. It was important for her to
          have her own domain and a place to house the site. I believe she is
          looking forward to where she would want more of a network and or
          education style site. Setting it up with name cheap was wonderfully
          easy and the customer service has been fantastic. The site has a
          subdomain at original.kathrynroberts-sc48.com. This subdomain is the
          original site and is very heavy. Large images and full bootstrap code
          are just some of the things creating the bloated nature. The home site
          has been evaluated and revamped to be streamed lined and quick.

        <p className='link-color'>SEO Concept</p>
        <p>
          Search Engine Optimization is not a strong suit of mine, however I
          realized there was a part of SEO that should be a part of every site.
          Google is the main service today that allows anyone to find
          information online. Search engines use bots to scrape common
          information to be organized and presented to you when you are looking
          for something. A developer can assist these bots by including meta
          information for the bots to use. Sites like Google, Facebook, and
          Twitter all use this meta information when linking to a site page.
          Meta tags are placed within the head of the page, so the information
          is available, but not displayed on the page. I include meta
          information for Google, Facebook, and Twitter in my site construction.
        </p>
        <p className='link-color'>Optimization</p>
        <p>
          When building a site, you have to consider the different devices it
          will be viewed on. Developers can set a page to be viewable from a
          desktop as well as a small mobile screen. Today a developer needs to
          write code to allow the browser to present different images or layouts
          given different platforms. I I use a site called Web Dev to test sites
          for optimization. This site gives a detailed report as well as
          documentation on how to accomplish different tasks to help stream line
          the site for the best response and upload times. For example, I used
          Bootstrap to create this site. When landing on the page, your browser
          had to download all of the Bootstrap css file, when I was only using a
          few parts of it. This was a large amount of data the site had to deal
          with, but never used. Using Web Dev, I was able to locate this
          specific concern and rework the site css file to use only the parts I
          was using.
