          A WordPress site that allows you to inform potential clients about
          your products or services. WordPress is used as a CMS (content
          management system) allowing you to modify your products or services
          information. This site is typically used to inform a potential client
          and gather relevant information to assist in following up.

          I created a design concept for this site before creating it in
          WordPress and Elementor. In researching through UpWork for a client I
          ran across a copywriter who was looking for a site. I had also seen a
          dozen clients who were looking for Elementor developers. So I ran with
          the concept, layed out a design in Figma and created the site in
          WordPress with Elementor Pro.
