With the\n          new climate of covid 19, I was thinking of the new way of shopping. I\n          was looking into packaging the concept of creating a system that local\n          shops could put products online for local members to shop, pick or\n          have delivered.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I ran across a local sports health shop, located in a small shopping\n          center beside a well known gym with no web presence. The shop had\n          placed some photos of the interior and the street view for google.\n          Here I got an idea of the major products they sold. From this\n          information I created a frontend for this concept.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Looking through the photos I was able to find products the store\n          seemed to favor, located those brands online, and reworked images of\n          those targeted products to have a clear alpha channel at various\n          sizes. The site layout is an older one but has a modern feel.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Hand coded in VScode and set up on an AWS bucket. This showed the\n          potential for the site. With AWS it would be very scalable. I was very\n          pleased with how the mouse over state of the product examples turned\n          out. The site was built for desktop only and is currently only\n          suitable on desktop. Tablet is ok, but mobile is very disordered.\n          Fixing this is on my todo list.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The concept is still a work in progress and is why this project has\n          been set aside for the moment.
